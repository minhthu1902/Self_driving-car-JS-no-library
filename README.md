# Self_driving-car-JS-no-library
A simple application of neural network concept using Javascript no library to create self driving car app
Neural network  are computing system inspired by the biological neural network in our brain. 
Our car will do something with this above concept. Neurons on the first layer will be connected to the sensors. 
They will send signals forward a few times and the last layer will connect to the car controls to make it actually do something. 
Visualize using neural network and black box meaning that itâ€™s hard for human to understand what they are doing.
This small project is using neural network to apply to self car driving using Javascript, HTML and CSS to demonstrate a simple machine learning car stimulatio network running on its own on the road.
